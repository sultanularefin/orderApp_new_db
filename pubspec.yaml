description: A new Flutter application.

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GreatVibes-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/GreatVibes-Regular.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: Itim-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Itim-Regular.ttf
          style: normal
    - family: Poppins-ExtraBold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf
          style: normal
    - family: PatrickHand-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Patrick_Hand/PatrickHand-Regular.ttf
          style: normal

  #    - family: Tangerine

  #        - asset: fonts/Tangerine-Regular.ttf
  #          weight: 800
  #          style: italic


  #         - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #           weight: 700
